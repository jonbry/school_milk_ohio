The District_Dairy_Distances.xlsx file was created see how distance affected the bid amounts in the Ohio School Milk Market in the 1980s (the original data is from [Robert Porter at Northwestern](https://economics.northwestern.edu/people/directory/robert-porter.html)). The school district locations give a general approximation of the location of the district, as there many schools within each district (some were more spread out than others). About 2/3rds of the school district's coordinates were added manually, in which I typically used the High School as the primary location. 

Milk Processor/Firm locations were much trickier since the data is from the 80s and many of the businesses no longer exist. I primarily used the corporation lookup on state websites to find corporate addresses. This does not take into account multiple locations, which is likely for many of the large milk processors. A few of the firms were also just distributors and not processors, so it is unlikely that their corporate address is the same as the plant/fulfillment center.
